**4 ] Decision Tree Algorithms**
- Classification and Regression Tree (CART)
- Iterative Dichotomiser 3 (ID3)
- MARS : extends decision trees to handle numerical data better
- C4.5 and C5.0 (different versions of a powerful approach)
- Chi-squared Automatic Interaction Detection (CHAID)
- Decision Stump
- Conditional Inference Trees
- M5
- Pruning (reduce overfitting)
- Conditional Decision Trees
- Recursive Partitioning
- Greedy Algorithm
- ID3 algorithm
- Random forest
- SLIQ
- Boosted trees (ex : Adaboost)
- Bootsrap aggregated / Bagged (ex : Random Forest)
- Rotation forest
- Dual Information Distance (to avoid local optimality)
