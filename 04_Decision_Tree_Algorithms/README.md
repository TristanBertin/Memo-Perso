# 4 ] Decision Tree Algorithms





## Monte Carlo Tree Search(MCTS) and Conditional Inference Trees
- Alpha Go and Alpha Zero algorithms
- Conditional Inference Trees

## Pruning
- Alpha Beta Pruning (Chess)

## Forests
- Random Forest
- Rotation forest
- 

## Boosting
- Bootsrap aggregated / Bagged (ex : Random Forest)
- Boosted trees (ex : Adaboost)

## Partitionning
- Recursive Partitioning

## Main algorithms
- Iterative Dichotomiser 3 (ID3)
- MARS : extends decision trees to handle numerical data better
- C4.5 and C5.0 (different versions of a powerful approach)
- M5
- ID3 algorithm
- SLIQ

## Others
- Classification and Regression Tree (CART)
- Chi-squared Automatic Interaction Detection (CHAID)
- Decision Stump
- Pruning (reduce overfitting)
- Conditional Decision Trees
- Dual Information Distance (to avoid local optimality)
