-  ### Policy Gradient Methods :
    - *type of reinforcement learning techniques that rely upon optimizing parametrized policies with respect to the expected return (long-   term cumulative reward) by gradient descent*:
    - Score Function Gradient Estimator
    - “Vanilla” Policy Gradient Algorithm
    - Connection to MPC
