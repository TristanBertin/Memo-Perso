# 5 ] Statistical Theory

- PyMc:
  - **1 Intro** : define a simple probabilistic model, number of text messages per day -> bayesian approach
  - **2 Exemples of bayesian models** : This chapter introduces more PyMC3 syntax and variables and ways to think about how to model a system from a Bayesian perspective.
  - **3 Introduce MCMC** and present the visualize traces, present autocorelation between samples + great exemple of probabilistic clustering + interest of MAP to start your MCMC\
  - **4**
  - **5 Priors** How to choose an appropriate prior distribution. We also present how the prior's influence changes as our dataset increases, and an interesting relationship between priors and penalties on linear regression.  
     - Wheimart Distribtion (PSD matrices)
     - Gamma and Beta Distribution
     - Bayesian Multi-Armed Bandits (exploration vs. exploitation dilemma)
     - Prior on a Covariance Matrix
